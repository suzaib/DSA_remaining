Segment Trees

Use Case: consider and array [0,2,1,2,5], and we have to find max in range [1,4] (these are indices), the max value between index 1 and 4 is 5, similar minimum value is 1
We can also be asked to this step for n times, say n queuries, having different indices
Brute force solution will be to run a loop from low range to high range, which can be n at worst case
If there are a total of n queries, then applying the brute force, we will have to run the loop for n*n times

Segment Trees can do this in logn time compare to n2
Consider array : [2,1,0,4,3,7]
Form a index node which denotes range from 0-5 index, keep splitting it like the merge sort, similar to binary trees
0-5 splits to 0-2 and 3-5, 0-2 splits in 0-1 and 2-2, 0-1 splits to 0-0 and 1-1, this is where our base case is
0-0 node will be filled by min value occuring in range arr[0] to arr[0] which is arr[0]=2, similarly 1-1 will be filled with 1
Now taking from these two the min value, we can fill the above node 0-1, which will get value 1(min of child nodes)
Keep doing the same thing and your visual segment tree is formed

Now let's draw this tree in code, we will use a similar concept to heaps, just like heaps were also binary tree which were denoted through arrays, we do the same here
The first node will be node 0 and will be stored at index 0 of the segment array
The left child will be 2*idx+1 and the right child will be 2*idx+2
For memory, just start numbering the nodes from 0, level wise, and skip the numbers if the nodes aren't there

We also need to know how much longer array would we need for storing the full segment tree
There's a proof that shows to store the segment tree we will need an array of size O(4n), which will always have enough space
The proof is quite long and hence we will not discuss it. n in the above is the size of the array

First up is building the segment tree
The basic recursion will look like:
f(idx,low,high){
    if(low==high) return seg[idx]=arr[low]
    int mid=(low+high)>>1
    f(2*mid+1,low,mid)
    f(2*mid+2,mid+1,high)
    seg[idx]=min(seg[2*mid+1],seg[2*mid+2])
}
Time Complexity can be at max 4n since this segment array will be at max 4n nodes and we also know that each node will be traversed
Time Complexity will be O(4n) in worst case, but most often we can say it will be around O(n)



Now dealing with the queries
Below we are talking about the overlap between the node index and range
For eg a node indexed 0, and we are looking at a range of say index 2 to 4(careful, each node also has a range associated with it, we are not talking about the node's range, this is the range of the query, the question)
1) Partial Overlap  : return (min(leftNode,rightNode))
Consider the query is to find the range within 2-4 and the node has the range associated with it as 0-5, this is a partial overlap
Since the node's range has some part overlapping, this is partial overlap. In this case return min(leftNode,rightNode)
The query being 2-4 and the node's range being 1-2 is also partial overlap

2) No Overlap : return INT_MAX (since we are looking for min value)
If the query is 2-4 and we have a node whose range is 0-1, this is no overlap, in this case return INT_MAX

3) full Overlap
If the query is 2-4 and the node's range is 3-3, return seg[idx] in this case of full overlap

Let us tell by an example
Consider the array [1,3,2,0,4,5] we always start from the 0th node which will have the range as 0-5 (6 elements in total)
Consider the query to be 2-4, 0th node in that case is having partial overlap therefore it will return (min(leftNode,rightNode))
The left node is 0-2 and the right node is 3-5 both of which again have partial overlap
Now consider the 0-2 return min(leftNode,rightNode), its left node will be 0-1, this will return INT_MAX since no overlap(and hence it contributes nothing) 
And the right node would be 2-2 which is a full overlap
Therefore the right node will return seg[idx]
This will keep happening

Now consider l and r be the query range and low and high denote the range associated with the node
Then our three cases would be :
No overlap       : if r<low || high<l
full Overlap : low>=l && high<=r
Partial Overlap  : no need for condition, will be handled by the else case

Types of Queries
1) One is the normal one where we say find the min in range [l,r]
2) This asks us to update the val of a given idx, so we have to change the whole segment tree as well

Point Update
For the second type of query, something like the point update comes in
Consider we have to change the value at index 2, start from 0-5, which way does the index lie? left side, 0-2, right side 2-2, here update the value
After you have updated the value, again take the min(left,right) and keep doing that till you reach the index 0 node
This was the point update
The code will look similar to below one, where _idx is the index which needs to be replace with value val
update(idx,low,high,_idx,val){
    if(low==high){
        //this is the moment where we have reached the _idx, so change value here 
        seg[low]=val
        return
    }
    mid=(low+high)/2
    if(_idx<=mid){
        //This case means we need to move left
        update(2*mid+1,low,mid,_idx,val)
    }
    else update(2*mid+2,low,mid_idx,val)
    //Now that we have traversed left and right, we must update the min values
    seg[idx]=min(seg[2*mid+1],seg[2*mid+2])



We will now discuss the time complexity for queries
In case of full or no overlap, we simply return, therefore time taken O(1)
So we need to study the time taken in case of partial overlap only

First let's consider small range, in that case most time we will get no overlap due to small range of query, and mostly we will have to travel to deepest point for only some time
Therefore in case of small query range, time taken will be logn (time taken to reach the depth of tree)

Incase of very large query range, most of the cases will be of full overlap so we return mostly, again we can say that at max logn will be the time taken
Incase of medium overlap we can also say that at max the depth of the tree will be covered since partial overlaps won't be that much
Therefore Time Complexity will be O(logn), this can be 2logn or 3logn etc



Solving a problem
Consider two array arr1 and arr2 and we have to find min in l1,r1 and l2,r2 (1 refers to arr1 and 2 refers to arr2), and then give the overall minimum value
Or we have to update the value of a particular index
The first type of query is denoted by 1 and given as 1 (l1,r1),(l2,r2)
The second type of query is denoted by 2 and given as 2 arrNo , ind, val (arrNo denoted in which arr we have to do the change)
The obvious solution to the problem is to create two segment array for each tree and solve the problem individually for each tree and then find the minimum of both the answers (for query 1)
For query type 2, we can update the segment arr of that particular tree, that's all

A better way is to create a class template and create two objects, object1 and object2

Therefore we will be creating a class and inside that we will put all our code

Handling Range Updates
Earlier we only used to update point in the segment tree
Now we will be given a range k and we need to update it
Brute Force
Loop from l to r and update using the concept of point update
Point update takes logn time so this will take klogn time
The optimal method to do this is called lazy propagation in segment trees

Lazy Propagation
Step 1 : Update the node when you see it
Step 2 : After updating, propagate the update downwards

Doing Range Updates
Increase the value by val(given)

Some Rules to follow
Traverse the tree and you will get three conditions
1)Complete Overlap : Update the node, lazy propagate down and return
2)No Overlap : Just return, no need to do anything
3)Partial Overlap : Call left, call right and then use node=left+right
