/*Heap is just a binary tree, a complete binary tree, with heap order property
Complete binary tree is filled at all levels except the last one, please see some examples, it is not exactly what you think
Remember a tree is always filled(just basic convention) from the left hand side, in the inOrder way
This convention is highly important when we talk about complete binary tree
Heap order property is of two types, max heap, min heap
Max heap means that every child is smaller than the parent
Min heap means that every child is bigger than the parent
